1. Use fewer than 30 words per sentence
1. Use subject-verb-object sentences with "doers" and "action"
1. Avoid clutter words and phrases (e.g., "due to the fact that," to "Because")
1. Avoid jargon and acronyms as much as possible. They exclude newcomers and non-experts
1. Remove weak words like: would, might, should, significantly, and arguably
1. Eliminate weasel words, replace adjectives with data (e.g., "Sales increased significantly," to "Sales increased by 30%")
1. Does your writing pass the "so what" test? At the end of your document, has the reader learnt anything that will help them make a better decision?
1. If you are asked a question, start your response by directly answering the question.
